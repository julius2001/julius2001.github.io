I am happy to announce the release of my first studio recorded album with piano music by J.S. Bach and J. Brahms.
In front of the op. 76 cycle of 8 Piano Pieces by Brahms that are rarely played in complete, the album features one of my personal
favourites from Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier, the B minor prelude and fugue from the first book.
