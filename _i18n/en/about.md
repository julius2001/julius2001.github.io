The pianist and bass-baritone, born in 2001 in Schleswig, Northern Germany, began his varied musical education 
in his early childhood. After initially learning the basics of the piano on his own as well as singing in church choirs
and playing the violin and viola, he began his piano education at the age of 10 with the Irish-German pianist
**Kevin McKenna**.
It was precisely this self-taught method that gave him an extremely natural and personal approach to music right
from the start.
This was followed by numerous concert appearances (also in cooperation with the state theater of Schleswig-Holstein)
and prizes at competitions (including the **national Jugend musiziert competition**).

After graduating from high school, he began his studies for an artistic piano bachelor's degree at the
**University of Music in Karlsruhe, Germany**, in 2019 with **Prof. Kalle Randalu**, which he completed with distinction
in 2023.
In 2022, Julius von Forstner enthusiastically completed an ERASMUS exchange semester at the Arctic University of
Tromsø, Norway, with **Prof. Sergej Osadchuk**.
He also received further important impulses from Heike Allardt, Andrej Jussow, Vadim Palmov,
at the Mattheiser Summer Academy, the Nordland Chamber Music Course and from **Prof. Christopher Park** during the
Voksenåsen Summer Academy.

In addition to chamber music, song interpretation and contemporary music, his studies at the Karlsruhe University of
Music also sparked a great interest in classical singing.
In 2023, Julius von Forstner therefore began his **classical singing studies** with **Prof. Holger Speck** as a
bass-baritone and has already built up a broad repertoire of **songs as well as oratorio and opera arias**.
The combination of piano and singing offers him ideally complementary skills that greatly enrich him
as a musician.

In the fall of 2023, Julius von Forstner moved to **Oslo, Norway**, also because of his great enthusiasm for the country
and its culture. At the **Norwegian Academy of Music**, he began his master studies in performing arts with
**Prof. Håvard Gimse**. At the same time, he is continuing his vocal studies at the Arctic University in Tromsø with
**Prof. Anne-Lise Sollied** and **Prof. Carlo Allemano**.
