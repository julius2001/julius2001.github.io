I am happy to announce the release of my first studio recorded album with piano music by J.S. Bach and J. Brahms.
In front of the op. 76 cycle of 8 Piano Pieces by Brahms that are rarely played in complete, the album features
one of my personal favourites from Bachâ€™s Well-Tempered Clavier, the B-flat minor prelude and fugue from the first book.
Both works, although very different in style and composing era, feature a very similar way of exposing a very
intimate feeling of nostalgia and loneliness. While Bach stays within this field of feelings, Brahms takes these as
a starting point to flourish into partly very contrasting character pieces that seem to me as if they contain the
depth and richness of a whole lifetime.
