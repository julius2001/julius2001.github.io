I am pleased to announce the release of a studio single with piano music by Amy Beach.
The piece "Out of the Depths", Op. 130 is based on the biblical Psalm 130
(Out of the depths I call to you, Oh lord) and is a beautiful example of the joy of
experimentation in late romantic piano music. Spending some time
with the works of composer Amy Beach, I have also realised how incredibly unknown
this very valuable music is! It is therefore very important to me to
shed some more light on this incredible music.
